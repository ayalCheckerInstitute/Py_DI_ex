# Be able to add two circles together, and return a new circle with the new radius - use a dunder method
# Be able to compare two circles to see which is bigger, and return a Boolean - use a dunder method
# Be able to compare two circles and see if there are equal, and return a Boolean- use a dunder method
# Be able to put them in a list and sort them

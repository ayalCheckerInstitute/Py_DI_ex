Battleship.
Lets first talk about the game itself and then the code.
The game is functional and very excited to see your first hackathon project!!!
Hopefully one in many future projects.
The page is built well with info on the left side and the game in the center.
I would look into a few issues:
There is no reset button - if I want to restart the game.
Once you are defeated- you can still click and it will tell you :
"You have -1 shots left"
"You have -2 shots left"
"You have -3 shots left"...
The game should stop at 0.
Now the code:
The code is well orginised and not over packed.
I like how you only have 5 functions.
You showed your understanding in loops,functions, dom manipulations...
Really good job.

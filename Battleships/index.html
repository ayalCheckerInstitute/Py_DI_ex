				Battleships is a strategy type guessing game for two players (or here,
				for a player and a computer). It is played on ruled grids on which each
				player's fleet of warships are marked. The locations of the fleets are
				concealed from the other player. Players alternate turns calling "shots"
				at the other player's ships, and the objective of the game is to destroy
				the opposing player's fleet.

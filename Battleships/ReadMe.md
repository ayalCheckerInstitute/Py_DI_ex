Battleships- Explaination:

1. Create a 10x10 matrix that stores the location of the submarines.
2. Write a function for every submarine (5 battleships: 1-slot battleship, 2-slot battleship, 3-slot battleship, 4-slot battleship, 5-slot battlehsip).
3. The battleships will be placed randomly on the grid.
4. User will be able to shoot and try to hit a battleship.
5. Number of tries will be logged/score will be calculated and logged.

If we have extra time, try to make a full game, where the user can also place his battleships and the computer will try to hit them aswell.

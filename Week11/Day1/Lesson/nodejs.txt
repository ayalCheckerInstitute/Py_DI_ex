node.js is an environment that allows us to run js outside of the browser.

we can write node in the cmd to access node.js and then we can write js inside!

to exit write CTRL+C twice.

what is the difference between node and the browser? in the browser you have
the UI while in node you don't. in node' you can read and write files on you system
while in the browser you can't.

library vs framework=> you can control the flow of your code in a library, while
in a framework you need to stick to the syntax of the framwork.
a library has more freedom

# Exercise 1 : Geometry
# Instructions
# Write a class called Circle that receives a radius as an argument (default is 1.0).
# Write two instance methods to compute perimeter and area.
# Write a method that prints the geometrical definition of a circle.


# Exercise 2 : Custom List Class
# Instructions
# Create a class called MyList, the class should receive a list of letters.
# Add a method that returns the reversed list.
# Add a method that returns the sorted list.
# Bonus : Create a method that generates a second list with the same length as mylist. The list
# should be constructed with random numbers. (use list comprehension).


# Exercise 3 : Restaurant Menu Manager
# Instructions
# The purpose of this exercise is to create a restaurant menu. The code will allow a manager to add and delete dishes.

# Create a python file called menu_manager.py.

# Create a class called MenuManager.

# Create a method __init__ that instantiates an attribute called menu. The menu attributes value will be all the
# current dishes (list of dictionaries). Each dish will be stored in a dictionary where the keys are name, price,
# spice level and gluten index (which value is a boolean).

# Here is a list of the dishes currently on the menu:

#     Soup – 10 – B - False
#     Hamburger – 15 - A - True
#     Salad – 18 - A - False
#     French Fries – 5 - C - False
#     Beef bourguignon– 25 - B - True

#     Meaning: For the spice level:
#        • A = not spicy,
#        • B = a little spicy,
#        • C = very spicy


# The dishes provided above should be the value of the menu attribute.

# Create a method called add_item(name, price, spice, gluten). This method will add new dishes to the menu.

# Create a method called update_item(name, price, spice, gluten). This method checks whether a dish is in the menu,
# if the dish exists then update it. If not notify the manager that the dish is not in the menu.

# Create a method called remove_item(name). This method should check if the dish is in the menu, if the dish exists
# then delete it and print the updated dictionary. If not notify the manager that the dish is not in the menu.

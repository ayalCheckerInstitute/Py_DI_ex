// Exercise 1 : Calendar
// Instructions
// Create a function called createCalendar(year, month)
// The function should create a calendar for the given year/month.
// The calendar should be a table, where a week is <tr>, and a day is <td>. The table top should be <th> with weekday names: the first day should be Monday, and so on until Sunday.
// For instance, createCalendar(2012, 9) should generate the following calendar:

// Hint: There shouldnâ€™t be any code in the HTML file. The table should be created from the JS file using the DOM.

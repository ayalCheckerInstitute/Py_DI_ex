# Exercise 1 : What’s Your Name ?
# Instructions
# Write a function called get_full_name() that takes three arguments: 1: first_name, 2: middle_name 3: last_name.
# middle_name should be optional, if it’s omitted by the user, the name returned should only contain the first and
# the last name.
# For example, get_full_name(first_name="john", middle_name="hooker", last_name="lee") will return John Hooker Lee.
# But get_full_name(first_name="bruce", last_name="lee") will return Bruce Lee.


# Exercise 2 : From English To Morse
# Instructions
# Write a function that converts English text to morse code and another one that does the opposite.
# Hint: Check the internet for a translation table, every letter is separated with a space and every word is
# separated with a slash /.
